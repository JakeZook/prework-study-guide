# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
This project is to create a simple, one-pager that will keep track of the notes and things I have learned in the prework project. This will allow me quick acces to keywords, instructions, and breakdowns of the steps needed to create more in the future.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)

## Installation

1. Download all software needed such as VSCode and Git.
2. Create a Github account.
3. Using Git, link your SHH code to your GitHub account or create a new one.
4. Create a new repo for your project.
5. Begin coding and creating new branches within Git to add features.
6. Save all files and merge the branches into Main.

## Usage

The page will display four blocks of text, each one a different topic. Each topic will provide notes about that topic. These topics are HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
